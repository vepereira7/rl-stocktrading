# Reinforcement Learning for Stock Trading
This project, carried out as part of TASI course, aims to develop an agent capable of trading stocks with profit.

## Abstract
This study explores the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning (RL) models, specifically A2C and PPO, in stock trading, using Apple Inc. stocks as a case study. The research highlights the strengths of these models in managing investment risks and optimizing profitability, with a particular emphasis on the superior performance of the PPO model in key areas. Despite the high computational cost associated with RL due to extensive training requirements, the potential financial rewards post-training justify the investment. The adaptability of RL models is showcased, suggesting their applicability beyond single stock trading to diverse trading scenarios and financial instruments. This aligns with the current trend of integrating advanced machine learning methods in finance, potentially rev- olutionizing trading decisions. The study opens new avenues for further exploration in applying RL models across different market conditions and financial tools, indicating a future where algorithmic trading is closely intertwined with machine learning advancements. This research contributes to the discourse in finance, suggesting a transformative impact on financial decision- making processes.
